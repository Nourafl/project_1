What are early intervention services?
</h3>

<p>
Early intervention services are a range of targeted services 
to help young children who have developmental delays or specific 
health conditions.
</p>
<p>

Providing services early helps children
catch up and increases their chances for success 
in school and life overall.
</p>


<h3>
Who’s eligible for early intervention services?
</h3>
<p>
Early intervention is for children from birth to age 6.
To be eligible, your child must have either:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A developmental delay—be far behind other kids his age.</li>
<li>A specific health condition that will probably lead to a delay—this
includes genetic disorders, birth defects and hearing loss, but typically
 not learning or attention issues like dyslexia and ADHD.
</li>
</ul>
